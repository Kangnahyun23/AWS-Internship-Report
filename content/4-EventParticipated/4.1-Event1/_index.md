### What I Learned
- Always start with business needs, then choose the appropriate technology.
- Migration requires a clear roadmap, executed in phases rather than a "big bang" approach.
- Amazon Q Developer has great potential in accelerating SDLC.
- Security must be integrated from the beginning (security by design).

### Application to Work
- Organize event storming with the team to identify practical GenAI use cases.
- Experiment with Amazon Q Developer in the current workflow.
- Apply phased migration method for cloud projects.
- Integrate DevSecOps to ensure security throughout the development process.

### Personal Experience
Attending Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 was truly an eye-opening experience for me. The professional organization and the vibrant atmosphere of the builder community in Ho Chi Minh City gave me a lot of inspiration.
- I was particularly impressed with the real-world case studies from Techcombank and U2U Network, which helped me visualize how large enterprises are applying cloud technology to solve specific business problems.
- Listening directly from senior leaders of AWS and other companies helped me understand that Cloud is not just technology, but a core strategy.
- Beyond learning, I had the opportunity to network with seniors in the industry and received valuable advice on career development paths.

### Key Takeaways
- **Strategic Thinking:** Technology must always serve business goals. Choosing AWS services should not be based solely on features but also on cost-effectiveness and scalability.
- **The Power of GenAI:** GenAI is shifting from "experimentation" to "practical application" very quickly. To not be left behind, I need to proactively update and master these tools.
- **Importance of Community:** Participating in events like this helps update trends fastest and expand professional networks, which is extremely important for future career.

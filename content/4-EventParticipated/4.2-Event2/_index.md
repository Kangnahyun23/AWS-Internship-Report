### AI-Driven Development Workshop – Shaping the Future of Development

**Time:** 14:00 – 16:30, Friday, October 3, 2025

**Location:** AWS Event Hall, 26th Floor – Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City

**Speakers:** Mr. Toan Huynh, Ms. My Nguyen

**Coordinators:** Diem My, Dai Truong, Dinh Nguyen

### Event Objectives
- Share new trends in AI-orchestrated software development (AI-Driven Development).
- Introduce the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) framework – an AI-integrated model throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Live demonstration of two key tools: Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE Extension.
- Analyze how AI helps improve productivity, speed, and quality of software products.
- Orient the future role of AI in modern software development.

### Content and Highlights

#### 1. Opening – Shaping the Future of Development
Mr. Toan Huynh opened with the topic “Shaping the Future of Development”, emphasizing the shift from traditional development models to AI-Orchestrated Development – where AI plays a supporting and coordinating role from planning, design, coding to testing and deployment.

#### 2. Challenges in Current Development Models
AI-Assisted Development and AI-Managed Development models still have limitations: lack of stability, difficult to explain, and have not truly fulfilled the promise of "acceleration by AI". The speaker introduced the concept of AI-Driven Development (AI-DD) – an approach that balances automation and human control.

#### 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Model
AI-DLC is divided into three evolutionary levels:
- **AI-Assisted Development:** AI supports code generation, suggestions, syntax checking.
- **AI-Driven Development:** AI participates in architectural design, planning, and decision support.
- **AI-Managed Development:** AI automatically orchestrates the development process with human approval.
In this model, AI acts as an "intelligent coordinator", while developers retain decision-making power and responsibility for verifying output.

#### 4. Benefits of AI in Software Development
Integrating AI brings seven key benefits: Predictability, Velocity, Quality, Innovation, Developer Engagement, Customer Satisfaction, Productivity.

#### 5. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The development process includes stages: Explore & Plan → Create → Test & Secure → Review & Deploy → Maintain, Transform & Modernize. AI helps shorten time in labor-intensive stages like testing, deployment, and maintenance.

#### 6. Live Demo: Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE
**Amazon Q Developer:**
- AI assistant integrated into IDE (VS Code, Cloud9…).
- Automatically generates code, tests, writes documentation, and suggests AWS architecture.
- Supports updating prompt.md and automating CI/CD processes.

**Kiro IDE (presented by Ms. My Nguyen):**
- Extended IDE helps create and manage specification documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md).
- AI can create feature descriptions, define API flows, generate backend code.
- The demo illustrated the process of creating a Chat application with user authentication using AI.

### Personal Experience
This workshop completely changed my perspective on writing code. Previously, I focused heavily on syntax and detailed logic, but through the Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE demos, I realized the role of developers is shifting dramatically.
- Witnessing AI automatically generate an entire project framework and documentation from just a few prompts was truly a "wow" moment.
- Mr. Toan Huynh's sharing helped alleviate my anxiety about "AI replacing humans" and replaced it with excitement about having a powerful "assistant".
- I tried applying Amazon Q immediately to small exercises and saw a significant increase in debugging speed.

### Key Takeaways
- **AI is a Teammate, not a Rival:** Instead of fearing it, I need to learn how to communicate (prompting) effectively with AI to optimize my work.
- **Architectural Thinking over Coding:** When AI can write code, the value of a developer lies in system design, logical thinking, and quality control of the output.
- **Adapt Quickly:** Technology changes daily, and the AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Lifecycle) model will soon become the standard. Getting used to it early gives me a huge advantage when entering the real working environment.

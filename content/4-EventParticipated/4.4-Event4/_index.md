### DevOps Workshop on AWS

**Time:** Monday, November 17, 2025, 8:30 – 17:00

**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office

**Role:** Attendee

### Event Purpose
The workshop was designed to provide comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience with AWS DevOps services, including CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, container services, and monitoring & observability. The event aimed to help attendees understand DevOps culture, principles, and best practices while exploring how to practically implement DevOps processes on AWS.

### Program Overview
- **AWS Certification Roadmap:** Introduction to relevant certifications like AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, AWS Certified SysOps Administrator.
- **Next Steps:** Resources for continued learning and practice.

### Highlights
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** AWS CodePipeline provides a complete solution to automate software delivery from source to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Both CloudFormation and CDK provide powerful ways to manage infrastructure, with CDK offering a better developer experience.
- **Container Services:** AWS offers various container options (ECS, EKS, App Runner) for different use cases and complexity levels.
- **Observability:** CloudWatch and X-Ray together provide comprehensive monitoring and tracing capabilities.
- **DevOps Culture:** Success requires cultural change, not just tools and technology.
- **Best Practices:** Feature flags, automated testing, and incident management are essential for modern DevOps.

### What I Learned
- **DevOps is Culture First:** Tools are important, but cultural transformation is the foundation of DevOps success.
- **CI/CD Automation:** Automating the entire software delivery pipeline significantly improves speed and reliability.
- **IaC Benefits:** Infrastructure as Code allows for version control, repeatability, and faster infrastructure changes.
- **Container Strategy:** Choosing the right container service depends on complexity, team expertise, and operational requirements.
- **Observability Matters:** Comprehensive monitoring and tracing are essential to maintain reliable systems.

### Application to Work
- **Implement CI/CD:** Set up CodePipeline for automated deployments in current projects.
- **Adopt IaC:** Start using CloudFormation or CDK to manage infrastructure.
- **Container Migration:** Evaluate containerization opportunities for existing applications.
- **Improve Monitoring:** Enhance CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for better visibility.
- **DevOps Practice:** Apply DevOps principles and practices in daily work.

### Personal Experience
Before attending the workshop, I thought DevOps was just about tools like Docker or Jenkins. But this session helped me deeply understand the "DevOps Culture".
- Successfully setting up a CI/CD pipeline that runs automatically from code commit to production deployment was very satisfying. It made me realize how much repetitive time I could save.
- The Observability section with AWS X-Ray was impressive, like having "X-ray vision" into the application, knowing exactly where requests are slowing down.
- The hands-on labs helped me lose the fear of "deploying", as everything is now controlled and automated.

### Key Takeaways
- **Automation is Key:** Anything done manually more than twice should be automated. CI/CD not only speeds things up but also minimizes human error.
- **DevOps is Shared Responsibility:** It's not just DevOps engineers who need to know about CI/CD or Monitoring. As a developer, understanding this process helps me write better code that is easier to deploy and debug.
- **Measure Everything:** You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Setting up proper Monitoring and Logging from the start is crucial.

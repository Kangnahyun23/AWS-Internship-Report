### AI/ML/GenAI Workshop on AWS

**Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025, 8:30 – 12:00

**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office

**Role:** Attendee

### Event Purpose
The workshop was designed to provide hands-on experience with AWS AI/ML services, focusing on Amazon SageMaker for traditional machine learning workflows and Amazon Bedrock for generative AI applications. The event aimed to help attendees understand how to practically deploy AI/ML solutions on AWS and explore the latest capabilities in generative AI.

### Program Overview

#### 8:30 – 9:00 | Welcome & Introduction
- Attendee registration and networking opportunities.
- Workshop overview and learning objectives presentation.
- Overview of the AI/ML ecosystem in Vietnam.

#### 9:00 – 10:30 | Overview of AI/ML Services on AWS
**Amazon SageMaker – Comprehensive ML Platform:**
- **Data Preparation and Labeling:** Understand how to prepare datasets for machine learning, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and automated labeling capabilities.
- **Model Training, Tuning, and Deployment:** Explore SageMaker's training infrastructure, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment options including real-time and batch inference.
- **Integrated MLOps Capabilities:** Learn about SageMaker's built-in MLOps features for model versioning, monitoring, and automated retraining pipelines.

**Live Demo: SageMaker Studio Walkthrough**
Demonstration introducing the unified development environment for machine learning, including Jupyter notebook integration, experiment tracking, and visual workflow builder.

#### 10:45 – 12:00 | Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
**Foundation Models: Claude, Llama, Titan – Comparison & Selection Guide:**
- Understand the different foundation models available on Bedrock.
- Compare capabilities, use cases, and performance characteristics of models.

**Prompt Engineering: Techniques, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, Few-shot Learning:**
- Learn how to create effective prompts to get desired outputs from language models.
- Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Understand how to guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Architecture & Knowledge Base Integration:**
- Understand how RAG combines retrieving relevant information with generative capabilities.
- Learn how to connect Bedrock with vector databases and knowledge bases (Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Kendra).

**Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:**
- Agent architecture orchestrating multi-step processes.
- Content safety with Bedrock Guardrails.

**Live Demo: Building a Generative AI Chatbot using Bedrock**
Guide to creating a complete chatbot application: setting up the model, implementing RAG, configuring Agents, and adding Guardrails.

### Highlights
- **Comprehensive ML Platform:** SageMaker provides a complete end-to-end solution.
- **Generative AI Capabilities:** Amazon Bedrock provides access to multiple foundation models.
- **RAG Architecture:** RAG pattern allows building AI applications that can access specific knowledge bases.
- **Safety First:** Bedrock Guardrails ensure generative AI applications are safe and compliant.

### What I Learned
- SageMaker Studio significantly improves developer productivity.
- Foundation model selection depends on specific use cases and cost constraints.
- Prompt engineering is a critical skill improving model output.
- RAG architecture is essential for AI applications needing up-to-date information.
- Content safety must be considered from the start.

### Application to Work
- **Experiment with SageMaker:** Set up SageMaker Studio for data analysis projects.
- **Build RAG Applications:** Implement RAG using Bedrock for internal documentation systems.
- **Practice Prompt Engineering:** Create templates and best practices for common use cases.
- **Implement Safety:** Integrate Bedrock Guardrails into generative AI applications.

### Personal Experience
This was the most hands-on workshop I have ever attended. Building a chatbot using RAG architecture on Amazon Bedrock myself helped me "demystify" complex terms that I had only read about in theory.
- The SageMaker Studio interface is very intuitive, making ML lifecycle management much easier compared to setting up a local environment manually.
- The most interesting part was seeing Bedrock Agents handle multi-step tasks; it felt like teaching AI how to think and act according to a desired process.
- I feel much more confident understanding Guardrails, knowing that I can control the content generated by AI.

### Key Takeaways
- **RAG is the Bridge:** For AI to be truly useful for businesses, it needs access to internal data, and RAG is the key to solving this problem without expensive model retraining.
- **Prompt Engineering is an Art:** The same model can produce completely different results depending on how the question is asked. This skill needs regular practice.
- **Security in AI:** We cannot just focus on features and ignore safety. Setting up Guardrails must be the first step in the GenAI application building process.

### 1. Knowledge Sharing (Technical Sharings)

After building **SorcererXtreme** from scratch to AWS deployment, I have 3 key takeaways that I believe are valuable for any Frontend Developer wanting to step into Cloud:

#### A. Amplify Gen 2: The "Lifesaver" for Frontend Devs
I used to think building Backend (Auth, API, Database) was a nightmare requiring too much knowledge (EC2, VPC, Nginx...). But **AWS Amplify Gen 2** changed the game:
*   **Code-First:** I just write TypeScript (`amplify/auth.ts`, `amplify/data.ts`), no manual console clicking.
*   **Fullstack Type Safety:** Backend types map automatically to Frontend, eliminating type errors.
*   **Conclusion:** Serverless has lowered the Cloud entry barrier significantly.

#### B. AI is not Magic (Understanding AI Integration)
I thought integrating AI into web apps was complex. In reality, with **Amazon Bedrock**, it's just... calling an API.
*   **RAG Model (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** I learned to make AI "smarter" by providing custom data (Tarot Books, Astrology Knowledge) stored in Pinecone Vector DB.
*   **Lesson:** Don't just use AI, "teach" AI with your data.

#### C. "Serverless First" Mindset
Shifting from "Renting Servers" to "Serverless" offers huge benefits:
*   **Cost:** No users = No cost (Lambda bills only when running).
*   **Ops:** No fear of server crashes during traffic spikes (Amplify auto-scales).

### 2. General Evaluation

Here are my thoughts on the internship environment at **AWS First Cloud Journey**:

**1. Work Environment**

The work environment is professional yet very open. Team members are always ready to support each other (Google Meet/Discord) day and night. Remote work but managed tightly with GitHub, keeping me on track.

**2. Mentor / Team Admin Support**

Mentors provide very detailed guidance, explain clearly when I don't understand, and always encourage me to ask questions. Team admins support with procedures, documents, and create favorable conditions for me to work. I appreciate the mentor allowing me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Job Fit**

The **SorcererXtreme** project was a perfect "test". It was hard enough (Next.js 14, AI, Vector DB) to challenge old knowledge, but interesting enough to inspire me every day.

**4. Skill Development**

Beyond technical skills (Next.js, AWS), I learned a lot of **Soft Skills**: Documentation, Communication, and Time Management to meet weekly deadlines.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**

"Work hard, Play hard". despite the project pressure (especially during AI integration), the team atmosphere was always positive. Everyone treats bugs as "features" to fix together, rather than blaming each other.

### 3. Other Questions

*   **What are you most satisfied with during the internship?**
    What I appreciate most is accessing the latest technology (**Amplify Gen 2**). Instead of just learning theory, I got to "fight for real" building the **SorcererXtreme** project from A-Z. Seeing my product run smoothly in Production and successfully integrating AI is incredibly satisfying.

*   **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**
    I think the program should add an in-depth **Workshop on Cost Optimization** right from the first week. With Cloud services, forgetting to turn off a Resource (like NAT Gateway or RDS) can incur large costs, which sometimes causes anxiety for newcomers.

*   **Would you recommend this internship to your friends? Why?**
    Definitely **YES**. This is not a place for "fetching coffee". You are thrown into real projects, have to swim on your own (with Mentors as lifebuoys), and face real deadlines. That is the fastest way for an IT student to grow.

### 4. Suggestions & Desires

*   **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
    There should be short weekly **Tech Talks** for interns to share the technologies they are exploring (e.g., this week I learned about Vector DB, next week another friend shares about DevOps). This helps spread knowledge across teams.

*   **Do you want to continue this program in the future?**
    I really want to continue accompanying **AWS First Cloud Journey** at more advanced stages (Advanced Level), or have the opportunity to participate in larger real-world projects of the company to practice Solution Architect skills.

*   **Other comments:**
    Thank you Team Admin and Mentors for always supporting enthusiastically. A nearly 4-month journey is not too long but enough to change my programming mindset from "Coder" to "Builder".

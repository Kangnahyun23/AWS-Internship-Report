During my internship at ** AWS First Cloud Journey** from **04/09/2025** to **28/11/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **building the "SorcererXtreme" application on AWS platform**, through which I improved my skills in **Programming (Next.js, Tailwind), Cloud Computing (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3), CI/CD, and Project Management**.  

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

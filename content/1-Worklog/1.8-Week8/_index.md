* Automate Operations with AWS Lambda and Systems Manager.
* Basic Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material |

| 2 | - **Automation with AWS Lambda:**<br>+ Learn about Serverless and Lambda functions<br>+ Write Python (Boto3) function to auto Start/Stop EC2 instances on schedule<br>+ Configure EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) to trigger Lambda | 10/27/2025 | 10/27/2025 | Cloud Journey - Optimize |
| 3 | - **Advanced Observability:**<br>+ Create custom Dashboards on CloudWatch<br>+ Integrate CloudWatch with SNS for Email/SMS alerts<br>+ Learn about Grafana (if covered) | 10/28/2025 | 10/28/2025 | Cloud Journey - Optimize |
| 4 | - **AWS Systems Manager (SSM):**<br>+ Install SSM Agent on EC2<br>+ Use Session Manager to remote into EC2 without opening port 22 (SSH)<br>+ Use Run Command to execute commands on multiple servers simultaneously | 10/29/2025 | 10/29/2025 | Cloud Journey - Optimize |
| 5 | - **Resource Management & IaC:**<br>+ Use Tagging Strategy for cost and resource management<br>+ Learn basic AWS CloudFormation<br>+ Create a simple Stack (e.g., create S3 bucket using YAML/JSON code) | 10/30/2025 | 10/30/2025 | Cloud Journey - Optimize |
| 6 | - **Week 8 Review:**<br>+ Review implemented automation solutions<br>+ Evaluate effectiveness of SSM vs traditional SSH | 10/31/2025 | 10/31/2025 | Self-review |


### Week 8 Achievements:

* Started adopting "Automate everything" mindset in system operations.
* Wrote practical Lambda function to save costs (stopping servers off-hours).
* Managed servers more securely and professionally with Systems Manager (no Bastion Host needed).
* Understood Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts preparing for larger deployments.

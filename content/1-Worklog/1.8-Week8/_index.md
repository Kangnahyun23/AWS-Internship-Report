### Week 8 Outcomes
*   Initial approach to "Automate everything" mindset in system operations.
*   Wrote practical Lambda function to save costs (stop servers during off-hours).
*   Managed servers more securely and professionally with Systems Manager (no Bastion Host needed).
*   Understood Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concept to prepare for large deployment problems.
*   Completed the midterm competency assessment exam.
* **SorcererXtreme Project:**
    * Mastered the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) flow.
    * Built Lambda functions to convert text data into Vectors and store them in Pinecone.
